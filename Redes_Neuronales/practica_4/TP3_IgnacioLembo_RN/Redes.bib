	abstract = {A group of barchans, crescent sand dunes, exhibit a characteristic ﬂying-geese pattern in deserts on Earth and Mars. This pattern implies that an indirect interaction between barchans, mediated by an inter-dune sand stream, which is released from one barchan’s horns and caught by another barchan, plays an important role in the dynamics of barchan ﬁelds. We used numerical simulations of a recently proposed cell model to investigate the effects of interdune sand streams on barchan ﬁelds. We found that a sand stream from a point source moves a downstream barchan laterally until the head of the barchan is ﬁnally situated behind the stream. This ﬁnal conﬁguration was shown to be stable by a linear stability analysis. These results indicate that ﬂying-geese patterns are formed by the lateral motion of barchans mediated by inter-dune sand streams. By using simulations we also found a barchan mono-corridor generation effect, which is another effect of sand streams from point sources.},

These fundamental transformations are found to generate the simple (alternating) group of even permutations which in turn is a subgroup of the permutation group. These functions are implemented with a class of programmable cellular automata ({PCA}) built around rules 51, 153, and 195. Further, high quality pseudorandom pattern generators built around rule 90 and 150 programmable cellular automata with a rule selector (Le., combining function) has been proposed as running key generators in stream ciphers. Both the schemes provide better security against different types of attacks. With a simple, regular, modular and cascadable structure of {CA}, hardware implementation of such schemes idealy suit for {VLSI} implementation.},

	abstract = {A short review of cellular automata models in ecology is given. Introduction of a spatial dimension into a discrete-time Markov chain leads to a class of cellular automata called spatio-temporal Markov chains ({STMC}). The behaviour of the model is determined by its temporal and spatial orders. It has been proven that {STMC} models have ergodic distributions in certain cases for spatial order 0. Simulations suggest that {STMC} models of higher spatial order also have ergodic distributions. The model of Dytham (1995) is demonstrated to be an {STMC}. Modelling population dynamics of three plant species on a lawn, two {STMC} models of different order are compared. The model validation shows a good agreement for Glechoma hederacea, but large deviations for Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens. The species-dependent performance of the models can be explained by selective grazing. Modiﬁcations of the transition matrices are used to examine possible causes of the deviations. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Barchans are crescent-shaped dunes that form under unidirectional wind in areas of limited sand supply. The recent development of ﬂume experiments and computer simulations has renewed interest in the interaction dynamics of two or more barchans. From the ﬂume experiment, four distinguishable types of collision patterns between two barchans have been observed: coalescence, ejection, split and reorganization. We have proposed a simple cellular model for numerical simulations of dune dynamics, in which saltation and avalanche are elementary processes. In the present paper, we ﬁrst describe the model in detail. The model reproduces three types of collision patterns: coalescence, ejection, and reorganization. The largest reason for a split pattern not to occur is the lack of an effect of the ﬂow separation at the brink line of dunes and the recirculation bubble that it produces. We then model the effect of the recirculation bubble by assuming that strong erosion occurs at the reattachment point of the separation ﬂow. The strong-erosion model successfully reproduces all the collision patterns. Thus, three elementary processes – saltation, avalanche and strong-erosion – are sufﬁcient for a phenomenological description of the interaction dynamics of aqueous barchans. It is also shown that the type of collision is determined by competition between the ﬁlling-up of the interdune between two barchans and the change in height of each dune.
