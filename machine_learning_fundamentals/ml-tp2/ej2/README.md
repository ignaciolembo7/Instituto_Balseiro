## Your first complete Machine Learning workflow

This is also a deliverable exercise.

In this exercise, you will use everything you have learned throughout these problems.

The dataset (the same one used in Exercise 5 for EDA) is provided in the `dataset/` directory.

You will need to complete the empty cells and make all the required implementations in `ej2.ipynb`.

Good luck! Feel free to ask for help if you need it
